A Laptop Price Prediction project involves collecting a dataset with features like brand, processor, RAM, storage, GPU, and price. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.​

Key Components:

Dataset: The repository includes a dataset (laptop_data.csv) containing information on different laptop models and their attributes.​

Jupyter Notebook: The laptop-price-predictor.ipynb notebook provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the entire process, from data cleaning to model evaluation.​

Model Pipeline: A serialized machine learning pipeline (pipe.pkl) is available for making predictions on new data.​

Web Application: The app.py script is designed to deploy the model as a web application, facilitating user interaction for price prediction.​
